    <h2>Current issue</h2>

    <p><br>
        the main bug in current version of webside is that:<br>
        the first tab of side menu bar will be treated as bottombtm obj in eventHandling<br>
        and I can't not figure out why it is being treated this way.<br>
        so when the home page of each area(bottom tab) is active(showing in the screen)<br>
        the highlight of first side menu will not disable even you click on other side menu,<br>
        and if you try to change area by click bottombtm, the bug will be corrupt the page
    </p>
