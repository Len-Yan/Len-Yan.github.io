    <h2>Hobbies HOME </h2>
    

    <p> <br>
        I am a indoor person, usually spend my free time inside of the room rather than go out do something.
        <br>Generally I play video games or watch Japenese animates when I am free.<br>
        relate to those, I also like to try modify simple local game's code to change game behavior;
        <br>learn Japenese Language and listen to Japenese related to animate.<br>

        But I don't just stay in the room all the time, <br>
        I like to went to University's SRC center to 
        workout at least once per week. <br>
        Every Saturday noon is the firm day I will go for it.
